    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <em>For the special tomato sauce:</em>
    <ol>
    <li>Cut an "x" on the bottom side of each tomato (the opposite of the core). 
        Place them in a heatproof bowl and cover the tomato with boiling hot water. Let the tomatoes sit in the hot water for about 10-15 seconds, 
        or until the skin around the "x" starts to peel back.</li>

    <li>Remove the tomatoes from the hot water and peel the tomatoes. Quarter the tomatoes and trim off the woody cores. Set aside until needed.</li>


    <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, drizzle in the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped garlic and cook until golden brown. 
        Add the tomatoes and cook for a minute then add the red wine and let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes or until it reduces by half.</li>


    <li>Blend the tomato sauce either using a hand mixer or a small blender until mostly smooth. Strain the sauce for extra smoothness.</li>


    <li>Transfer the sauce back onto a pan over medium low heat. Season the sauce with salt, sugar, and chicken stock powder and let the sauce come to a low simmer. 
        Take the sauce off the heat and "mount" in the cold butter by stirring it into the sauce until completely emulsified. Keep the sauce on low heat to keep warm until needed.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <em>For the soufflé omelet:</em>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat a nonstick pan over medium-low heat.</li>

    <li>In a clean mixing bowl, add the egg whites and beat until medium-stiff peak. The meringue should be able to form a peak but still very slightly curls at the hook.</li>


    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, heavy cream, and salt. Once homogenous, pour it on top of the meringue and gently fold it until no more large chunks of white is visible. 
        However, DO NOT overmix the meringue. Overmixing will cause the meringue to deflate and the omelette to collapse and become super flat.</li>

    <li>Add the butter into the preheated pan and swirl the butter around to spread. Pour the omelette meringue into the pan. Keep it piled high. 
        Using a rubber spatula, shape the omelette into a circle as best as you can, then spread the omelette to flatten it out to about 1 inch thick. 
        Cover the pan and let the omelette cook over medium low heat for 3 minutes until the bottom of the omelette is golden brown.</li>

    <li>Gently fold the soufflé omelette in half and slide it off the pan. Serve the omelette immediately with the special tomato sauce and a sprinkle of chopped or dry parsley.</li>
    </ol>
